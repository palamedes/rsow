Hey guys!  I'm stoked beyond words to see you here.  My name is Jason Ellis and I'm building an airplane!  Specifically a Van's Aircraft RV-10;  I realize there is a pretty good chance you already knew that but just in case you weren't sure what this whole thing was about, I made the video to the right. 

Long story, short;  I'm building an aircraft and documenting the process along the way.  Plus I'm taking the time to try to turn some of the lessons I learned the hard way into videos so that you guys can learn from them too!  No sense in both of us making a mistake.

I have them broken up into play lists by major kit; [Empennage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdrOhVh8bQQ&list=PLme5KP3gHSKxgMsZgnsenlwzUjsTNov8z){: .follow}, [Fuselage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv2uZHMsipM&list=PLme5KP3gHSKzQ6kjk2STbwzK0PVswkG5v){: .follow}, [Wings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgap7rFab5s&list=PLme5KP3gHSKw89LDN3ApiuqpMeiZHt_FN){: .follow} etc.. Plus I also go into details about specific fun stuff I figured out in my [Extras](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p368pyGkdCE&list=PLme5KP3gHSKxwq_BDCSfOuy-ElHzmQ93a){: .follow} play list.  


# TIP JAR!

If you enjoy what I'm doing I have a number of ways you can help support this crazy project.  

## Free things you can do!

Look I get it.. money is tight for everyone and the last thing you want or need to do is fork over your hard earned cash to some schlub on the internet making a plane.  No worries.  Completely understand and can sympathize.. (I mean I'm asking for money because I'm in the same boat!)   

But what you can do that's completely free and costs you nothing is click that **like button** on videos and **subscribe** to the channel.  It may seem silly but believe or not that simple act pushes my ratings up on Youtube which in turn causes the videos and channel to be pushed out in front of other people.  
 
Just the act of **commenting on a video** will help cause a video to sky rocket.. even if the comment is just you saying hello!

The aviation community is full of like minded awesome folks who just want to chat up all things aviation.  Leave a comment and make some new friends.   Or if you see me doing something wrong, please tell me!  I don't pretend to know everything..

## Patreon

I am on Patreon because my viewers asked for it!  I took delivery of my RV-10 empennage kit Valentines day February 14th, 2015.  I started working immediately.  Initially my intent was to just document the process with some minor voice overs and comments.  Over time due to questions, comments and participation from users like you I have turned the videography has taken on a life of it's own with the intent of being more professional and actually delivering content to the end users that's worth watching.  

I'd like to continue to do that.  Better videos, better content, more teaching.. and more planes!  I'd like to turn this into a full time job;  teaching people to build planes.  What a dream!

Head over to my Patreon page and take a look, sign up if you're so inclined..  For as little as a dollar a month you can help support the channel.

## Paypal

Some of you may not trust Patreon or not want to use them. I get it, totally cool.   I also have Paypal setup so you can send me a one time donation that way if you so choose.

## Referral 

If you do end up ordering your own Van's Aircraft then you can use my Builder number as a referral and Van's will send me $100 as a thank you.. No money out of your pocket at all!
