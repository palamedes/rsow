### Special Skills

I am a calm, considerate problem solver. I am a self taught software engineer and have worked with computers all my life. I am familiar with and have used most major operating systems and have an almost intuitive understanding of all major software packages, as well as having professional experience with most of them.

I enjoy rapid application development and web development. I have been working for years on the internet in one form or another coding all manner of rich web applications using Ajax, PHP, Javascript, Java, JSON, XML, XHTML DOM, ORM, CSS and every other trendy acronym you care to mention.

I have skills ranging from server installation and administration to in depth object oriented development in a myriad of languages, to include creation of special utilities and websites for top secret military projects.

I have experience teaching my computer skills to others and I enjoy a challenge.

### Personal Hobbies

I don't idle well.  I can't sit around and do nothing, as such I'm always doing something; usually making something.  I'm an avid woodworker and I enjoy building things.  I am always out in my garage puttering and tinkering on building something and also have an active Youtube Channel around my Van's RV-10 Experimental Aircraft build. 

### Law Enforcement and Software ?!?

People often wonder how one goes from Software development to Law enforcement, and back, and back again!  I get that question a lot.  The TL:DR is that after selling my first company I decided to make a radical career change in order to recapture some of that camaraderie that I was missing from the military and encourage a buddy of mine that was getting out of the Army at the time to go too.  I found a brotherhood of like minded individuals who did a hard job that was rewarding but in the long run due to a very hostile work environment (the department itself) I had to make a change.  I went back into software and spun up a couple companies before burning out completely.  I went back to law enforcement again just as something to do.  Feel free to ask I can go into this further.
