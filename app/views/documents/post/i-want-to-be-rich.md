![Chasing Money](/images/2018/rich-chase.png){: .float .right .scaled}

I got into a debate today with some people about what they liked to term "Wage Slavery".

The basic premise was, in 1990 the wealthy were getting more wealthy while they "slaved" away as a normal wage earner.   And in 2018, the gap between the two extremes is way larger.  The rich are massively richer, where as the wage earners are at the same place.   
 
As if to say we needed to do something to help those poor people who do all the work!  Of course, all the while their talking positions and language was laced with self-aggrandizing pity and self-interest for the need to give the poor (that they self identified as) free shit! (read: take money away from the greedy rich whom obviously dont deserve it.)

To which I said;  Or, you could just do what the "rich" have done and stop working for "the man" and take some risks.  Start a business!  TRY!  Put yourself out there!  How do you think the rich became rich in the first place?!  Risk takers get rich and deserve the lion share of the profits because of said risk, the wage earner will never be rich.

Holy shit.. You'd think I pissed in their cereal.  All of them suddenly had the look on their face like they tasted butt.. Uh oh.. I just became public enemy number one by upsetting the proletariat and not towing the "give me free shit" line.

I love how "the rich" are always defined as some nebulous group of greedy people at the top that like to keep people under their boot and horde all the money.  And I routinely get ostracized as a heretical pariah or at the least persona non grata when I suggest that, No, they are people just like you and I that actually took a risk!  

Statistically I have no idea if the gap is that much greater now than it was in 1990..  But if you expect to keep doing the working day grind and suddenly get rich then you're in for a shock.  More over, there's this radical notion that people who earned money by taking the risk to get it, shouldn't be allowed to keep what they earned and some how they are being greedy for wanting to.. uh.. wut?

I just don't get it.. 

If you're not willing to try, if you're not willing to risk.. then you don't deserve the reward.  You don't get to bemoan your lot in life if you aren't willing to do anything to change it.   How is this even a discussion?!  

The biggest risk in life is to take no risk at all, if you're not courageous enough to try to excel then you need to accept being ordinary.
