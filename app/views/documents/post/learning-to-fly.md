Flying is an itch I need to scratch and I plan to follow through.  To that end I have been creating a serious of "Learning to Fly" videos on youtube in the hopes that they will help to keep me motivated!

These videos aren't really meant as entertainment but rather a training tool for me.  I'll be including them here or you can go over to my youtube channel and see them.

You can view the videos on my YouTube Channel here;  [https://www.youtube.com/user/vihravendrel/videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/vihravendrel/videos)
